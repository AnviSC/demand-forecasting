## ‚ú® Core Features

* **AI Forecasting:** Uses Facebook's `Prophet` model to analyze historical sales data and generate a robust, long-term forecast.
* **Live Data Integration:** Enriches the AI model with external data from **Google Trends** (for public interest) and **OpenWeatherMap** (for logistical planning).
* **"What-If" Risk Simulation:** An interactive "Risk/Tariff Factor" slider allows managers to instantly model the impact of external events (like new taxes or disruptions) on the forecast.
* **Prescriptive Analysis:** The dashboard automatically runs a supply chain analysis to generate:
    * **KPI Cards** (Avg. Sales, Inventory Status)
    * An **Inventory Gauge** (Days of Stock on Hand)
    * **Critical Alerts** (e.g., "Understocked," "High Volatility")
    * **Actionable Recommendations** (e.g., "Order 1,500 units immediately")
